# Mnist-gan
Developed in the Neural Networks course by: Diego Quezada and Kevin Reyes.
## Objectives
- Implement a Generative Adversary Network (GAN) to generate handwritten numbers based on initial random noise.
- Compare the result of the network of the random noise generated by two numbers and the number generated by the average of the noise of both numbers.

## Description
Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for predicting handwritten numbers.

## Conclusions
- The learning of the discriminator is faster than that of the generator, which can cause a stagnation in the learning of the generator, since it could reach the point where the discriminator always detects that the image is false and therefore never gives indications of the correct path to the generator.
- It should be sought that the discriminator and generator improve their performance in a similar way in training.
- The images are not entirely convincing, although patterns similar to real numbers are generated, there are certain traces of noise that do not correspond to the shape of the numbers.
- By applying the generator on the average of the random noise generator of two numbers, we obtain a number with characteristics of both generated numbers.
